My Personal Recipe Website
This is a personal website that I created to display three of my favorite recipes. The website only uses HTML, and no CSS or JavaScript.

Getting Started
To run this website, you will need to have the following installed:

A web server, such as Apache or Nginx
A text editor, such as Sublime Text or Atom
Once you have these installed, you can follow these steps to get started:

Clone the repository to your computer.
Open the index.html file in your text editor.
Edit the recipes to your liking.
Save the file and open it in a web browser.
The website will now be displayed.
